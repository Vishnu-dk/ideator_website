The authors undertook the design and implementation of such a robot as a senior engineering design project to investigate several new variations of this idea. This mobility is made possible using a set of free-spinning wheels, pitched like the blades of a turbine, which are rotated coaxially with the pipe, providing forward propulsion in the manner of a turning screw. Although some of the project goals were not completely fulfilled, efforts to correct any remaining deficiencies are ongoing.",

The design part consists of four steps: machine specifications, machine frame blue print, programming and electronics design. A PCB Mill is a device that etches out a pattern on a copper clad board such that it makes a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). PCBs are used everywhere in the field of electrical engineering to connect electrical components to one another. The advantage of the PCB Mill is its ability to create a prototype in less than a couple hours and at a much reduced cost compared to outsourcing. The current price of a commercial PCB Milling device is around 1 LAKH which is a significant investment for most small labs or individuals wishing to quickly prototype. The solution would be - Make a PCB Mill at low cost.",

The inverted pendulum balancer is a controllable cart with an inverted pendulum attached to it. The system combines together a computational hardware, an input angle sensor and an output motor driver on a single board .The purpose of the system is to autonomously control the motion of the cart in order to prevent the pendulum from falling. The inputs over limited time in the form of pendulum position readings are mapped using algorithm to output in the form of motor control. The feedback control algorithm calculates the error in angle from the reference and relates to the motor velocity and direction using PID algorithm.The pendulum can be balanced by fine-tuning the variables-corresponding to the PID equation-according to system behavior.",
